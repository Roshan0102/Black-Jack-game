 Blackjack is a card game where players aim to reach a hand value of 21 without going over. Players are dealt two cards and can choose to "hit" for more cards or "stand" to keep their current total. The dealer reveals their cards, and the closest to 21 without busting wins. Strategic decisions and luck make Blackjack engaging and competitive.
