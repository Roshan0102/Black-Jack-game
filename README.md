Blackjack Game Description:

Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played against the dealer. The objective is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Each card has a point value, and the game combines strategy and luck.

# Gameplay:

Card Values: Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits the player more.

Initial Deal: Players and the dealer are dealt two cards each. One of the dealer's cards is face-up, allowing players to see some of the dealer's hand.

Player's Turn: Players decide whether to "hit" (draw another card) to improve their hand's total value or "stand" (keep the current hand). The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Dealer's Turn: Once all players have acted, the dealer reveals their face-down card. The dealer must "hit" if their hand total is 16 or lower and "stand" if it's 17 or higher.

Winning: If a player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose. If their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without busting, they win. If the dealer busts and the player hasn't, the player wins. If both have hands of the same value, it's a "push" (tie).

# Key Terms:

Hit: Request an additional card to improve your hand's value.
Stand: Choose to keep your current hand and end your turn.
Bust: When a player's hand exceeds 21, resulting in a loss.
Blackjack: An Ace and a 10-point card as the initial two cards, giving an instant win.
# Strategy:

Players use strategies like hitting, standing, doubling down (doubling the bet after receiving two cards), and splitting (splitting pairs into separate hands) to optimize their chances of winning based on their hand and the dealer's visible card.

# Objectives:

The objective of Blackjack is to have a hand total closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without going over. Winning requires a combination of skill in decision-making, understanding card probabilities, and a bit of luck.

Remember, the game is about enjoying the process and trying to make the best decisions based on the cards you and the dealer have.
